    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h3>1. What is Click Swap?</h3>
    <p>
      Click Swap is a Nigerian tap-to-earn platform where users earn coins by tapping, referring others, and performing simple tasks. These coins can be converted into real money during admin payout periods.
    </p>

    <h3>2. How do I earn coins?</h3>
    <p>
      You earn coins by tapping the big coin, referring friends, watching videos, or engaging in approved tasks. Every action gives you more coins in your wallet.
    </p>

    <h3>3. How much is 1 coin worth?</h3>
    <p>
      1 coin = ₦0.10 (value may vary based on admin settings).
    </p>

    <h3>4. How do I refer others?</h3>
    <p>
      After signing up, you’ll get a unique referral link. Share it with friends — each time someone registers through your link, you earn 100 bonus coins.
    </p>

    <h3>5. When can I withdraw my coins?</h3>
    <p>
      Withdrawals are processed only during official payout times. You will be notified when you’re selected, and the admin will send the money directly to your bank account via Opay.
    </p>

    <h3>6. How do I get selected for a payout?</h3>
    <p>
      Admin manually selects active users based on activity, referrals, and other criteria. Not everyone is paid at once — but your wallet keeps growing.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Is Click Swap real or a scam?</h3>
    <p>
      Click Swap is a real, transparent platform manually managed by our team. Coins are tracked in your wallet, and real payouts are made. It’s built for Nigerians, by Nigerians.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Where does the payout money come from?</h3>
    <p>
      Funds come from advertising revenue, sponsorships, and platform promotions. This is why it's important users stay active and engage with the app to grow earnings for everyone.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Can I lose my coins?</h3>
    <p>
      No. Your coins remain safe in your account. But abusing the system or using bots may lead to suspension or loss of access.
    </p>

    <h3>10. Who do I contact for help?</h3>
    <p>
      You can reach us anytime via <a href="mailto:clickswapng@gmail.com">clickswapng@gmail.com</a> or on WhatsApp/Facebook via the links on our Contact Page.
